--------------------------------------- IIRS first phase production TODO:
remove http://annesley.parrot.transitionnetwork.org/wp-content/plugins/IIRS/IIRS_common/read_translations.php from live!
Wordpress Views function to control it?

--------------------------------------- points
Transition Town => Transition Initiative
  TI capitalised

--------------------------------------- IIRS SECOND phase production TODO:
make the plugin more generic for upload to the Wordpress repository
settings translation
Login in the header link. recommendation
  finish it!
  what is this conceptually?
warning if no country region bias was found
PNG translation helper => settings screen
introduce %townname% in to the sentence
make post-type configurable so that IIRS can be used by other organisations
Updraft Plus integration for backups of initiative and email data
allow upload of different picture on 1st screen
translate the google town name results:
  Belgium -> BÃ©lgiu
OVER_QUERY_LIMIT error from Google and other errors should suggest email registration
extra shortcode [iirs-map-international]
developer documentation doesn't work anymore
commenting / code documentation / re-visit / file headers
  split up utility.php in to sensible better named function files
  including a security.php
  move apply_coding_standards and read_translations in to the documentation area
  re-check coding standards: move everything to Wordpress standard for now (see apply_coding_standards.php)
    brakets and things
    sandboxed function names and require_once all done :)
    security reject print and echo statements anywhere but security.php
    check for magic_quotes on and processing in wp-settings.php
    add require_once checking in to code checker
initiative_profile slug not working on dev
  code is the same: it is a setup thing: ignore
http://snazzymaps.com/
enable false_submit checking
check any new edited domain in /IIRS/edit
threaded domain checking
  administrator can add more domains now through translate...!
/IIRS/view does not honour the <!-- more -->
  however, Luis will be using a template
IIRS/edit/index/index/index/index/index/index/index/index
JavaScript widget:
  HTML editor doesn't work
  ILLEGAL tokens from the compressed jQuery coming through on other processGroups
custom override standard template get_template_part( 'content', 'single' ) => to use content-initiative_profile.php
  but not *in* the_content filter: that is too late in the process
add $user_actions to messages / errors
better javascript form validation responses
  separate submit actions all fire their own alerts ATM
  required field checking just returns a false and highlights. needs to return field list also
use IIRS_0_remove_transition_words when registering!
  causes un-necessary conflicts between names ATM.
  allow open registration for now
  manual sanitisation can be carried out easily from the data
move and abstract the whole $widget_folder -> action in to IIRS_common
block anonymous registration of TI
move to stdClass based TIs, Users, etc. in IIRS_common if it starts to expand a lot
the_title for IIRS full TI view (not used before)
integrate with a mapping plugin
recommend during installation twig and post_formats
email address validation in JS widget still submits the form
wordpress settings link up (lot of work surprisingly -> feedback first, some of framework is there)
auto / or in settings.page setup a generic menu

Plugins and widgets:
  register themselves with TN.org
    domain, type (widget/plugin), host system (WP / Drupal / x), last accessed, last amalgamated, altered, new fields
    ask before TN.org registration happens
    pull sync + push sync (just in case)
    use framework content-type
    implement Drupal functionality first

cache:
  server location lookups and things
list
  auto-ajax-pager on scroll to bottom (not enough registrations to warrant this)
    requires paging functions on server...
  restrict to current country?
    -> no, all registrations on this server + all relevant country registrations on TN.org
    that requires the XML sync to be working
  order by date added desc
Wordpress
  siderbar widget?
  make sure permalinks are set on with an valid .htaccess in the plugin activation
  check Wordpress geotag functionality on posts
    maybe optionally detect presence of popular geotag plugins
    maybe make it a requirement?
  shortcodes for WordPress rather than pretending its a "node"?
  move everything in to the class.iirs.php
  feed wordpress plugin layout back in to the Drupal plugin: abstract wp_enqueue_javascript() = drupal_add_javascript()
  settings admin page
  internationalise the plugin
search screen DROPPED
what happens if the uid owns several TIs?
json_encode PHP4
Wordpress 3.9.1
  show_page() using filters
  menu_registration
  <%=IIRS%> in-HTML key replaceement widgets
  display settings and other settings
multi form buttons submit to prevent robots
MX domain validation check
maximum results from google... and advice to narrow search
map zoom based typeahead for town area entry
refresh stopped working: makes loads of requests
back buttons not working
  double back buttons are failing
  back buttons re-submit form in widget: creating already in use warnings: use last HTML instead
throbber not spinning: move to asynchronous calls
TIs_nearby() calcs - important to do this for future proofing of concepts*
  use the view::load('nearby me') and set the Location: distance / proximity filter
better error reporting when TI save fails
validation messages combine and show in a DIV popup
take some style CSS out of Drupal plugin in to TN.org
calcs for if already registered
  using: TIs_nearBy()*
actual translations: where and how?
status will change => registered / active
add page titles
return a proper 404 if the page is not found
installation checks for jQuery
test that all functions are PHP 5.0 compatible (install on PHP 5.0.0 and see if works)
jQuery these event handlers need to be added once, not several times!
general.css is included in popup.php
  widgetloader.php loads popup.php, index.php and should load general.css also
  we need a multi-loader in one call
makes IIRS_0_hint generic
  and fix the initial value on back...
google not loaded in the popup system for the image search
get hook_menu() to deal with index.php and IIRS/registration better
Wordpress 4.0 plugin
content-type => features => IIRS.install
  or add dependency on initiative-profile CCK type?
IIRS flow:
  browse grass-roots strap lines
    sense of movement
  calculate the stage from the activity (number google results)
    from URL
    from websearch
Plugins, Modules & widgets should all:
  expose XML data for anyone amalgamation

--------------------------------------- IIRS thinking:
option 1: javascript widget
  uses the same form creation and sync logic as the shared plugin code
  uses javascript hooks on client site to alter functionality
  confiusion: search, login, linkage, topology
option 2: PHP plugin for WordPress, Drupal, etc.
  nat-hub must accept responsibility for owning data and users
  email addresses and passwords are sensitive

--------------------------------------- IIRS first phase production:
XML basic universal form elements definition
  content-type (views) => XML (Javascript / PHP) => HTML
  the plugin and the TN.org use this XML => HTML form code to produce the same HTML
  client can write Javascript or PHP hook functions to alter the form
