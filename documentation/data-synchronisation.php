<p>
  Note that installing this plugin will expose the Tranistion Initiative data on this server to Transition Network
  via the <a target="_blank" href="/IIRS/export/?password=fryace4">/IIRS/export/?password=fryace4</a> link.
  Please email <?php print( IIRS_EMAIL_TEAM_LINK ); ?> if you would like to prevent / discuss this option.
  The <a target="_blank" href="/IIRS/import/?password=fryace4">/IIRS/import/?password=fryace4</a> system is not yet
  active in this version of the plugin so no foreign data will appear in your system during synchronisation.
  However, in the future, data my be copied in to your server by Transition Network
