This is prototype code, throw away, proof-of-concept
It will be shared across multiple LAMP stack platforms
including, but not limited to, WordPress and Drupal
therefore is platform agnostic using as much common PHP 5.x code as possible
it also includes a framework for serving a Javascript widget to present the screens
not many libraries are used to improve portability

---------------------------------- terms:
Script Origin Host = the web server that is serving THIS script
Widget Host        = the website that this sciprt is being run on
IIRS               = International Initiatve Registration System
TI                 = Transition Initiatve
widget             = <script> tags that request Javascript that writes HTML directly out to the hosting webpage
plugin / module    = common PHP modules for LAMP stack frameworks

---------------------------------- widgetloader.php
IIRS Javascript widget
add script src="http://<host>/loader.php" to any website
DEPENDENCY: JQuery is required

---------------------------------- framework_abstraction_layer.php
the client is requesting this page to be displayed on the browser
everything using this is multi-deployment scenario code:
deployment for the page:
  Wordpress plugin  (the webserver is this one, NOT the referer)
  Drupal Module     (the webserver is this one, NOT the referer)
  JavaScript widget (the widget webserver is contained in the referer)
the client browser language is correct in all cases
so the code is all standalone PHP, framework independent
